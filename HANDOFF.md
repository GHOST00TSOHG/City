## Version
**v01: base scaffold** (2026-10-31)

## What changed
- Vite + TypeScript + `three` from npm, bundled; no CDNs (Inter font from `@fontsource/inter`).
- Night mood: ACES tone mapping, exp fog, cool moon key light, hemisphere fill, warm sodium city glow, wet reflective fallback ground, gradient sky with horizon glow.
- Camera: start over Twin Lights, Highlands NJ (public landmark), looking over the Bayshore. Slow auto-drift that stops on touch, damped OrbitControls, clamped zoom and tilt. Works on laptop and phone (lower pixel ratio and coarser tiles on touch devices).
- (v01 only, since removed) a temporary Google 3D Tiles backdrop. Gone in the rebuild.
- No key: fallback ground and sky, plus one `console.info` notice.
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore` (`.env*`), `.gitleaks.toml`, CI (gitleaks + build on PRs), CODEOWNERS, CLAUDE.md.
- Playwright smoke (`tests/smoke.spec.ts`): canvas visible, zero console errors, ≤ 150 draw calls, screenshots at laptop and phone sizes.

## Rebuild (Oct 31, 2026, approved by Luis)
Google 3D Tiles are gone. Each area is baked offline from OSM / OpenFreeMap / Overture / Mapterhorn (`knowledge/BAKE-PIPELINE.md`) and rendered with our own buildings. Phases follow the rebuild plan: 0 pipeline, 1 Key West ground/water/roads/buildings, 2 facades + night, 3 vegetation, 4 weather, 5 other areas + ferry, 6 interiors, 7 robot (customization, drop-in), 8 zombies, 9 multiplayer last. World first. City is a zombie survival game.

## How to run
`npm ci && npm run dev`  |  `npm run build`  |  `npm run test:smoke`  |  `gitleaks detect --redact --config .gitleaks.toml`

## Next
0. Move `ci/github-actions-ci.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the bot token lacked `workflow` scope), then enable it as a required check.
1. `tools/areas.json` + DEM terrain chunk for the Highlands/Bayshore area (BUILD-GUIDE §3).
2. Finish phase 2 (facades, trees, lamps), then phases 3-6 (world) before robot and zombies.
3. Add Playwright smoke to CI, weather-state checks, more fixed cameras in `tests/cameras.json`.

## Known bugs
- Keyed view: about 113 draw calls on laptop and 66 on phone (inside the 150 budget). Headless SwiftShader fps is low (7-20); check fps on a real GPU.
- Bundle is about 560 kB (139 kB gzip); code-split later.

## Usage notes
Built on Grok Bot (no Claude). Estimate for v01 streets: medium.
